# JWT-Authentication-in-Spring-Boot
 This project demonstrates how to implement JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a Spring Boot application. It includes user registration, login, and secured access to API endpoints. JWT is used for stateless authentication, providing token-based security for the application. The project follows best practices for securing RESTful APIs.
